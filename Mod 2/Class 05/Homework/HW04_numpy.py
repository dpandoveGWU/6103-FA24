list2 = [ [11,12,13], [21,22,23], [31,32,33], [41,42,43] ] # two dimensional list (2-D array)  # (4,3)
nparray2 = np.array(list2)
print("nparray2:", nparray2)

# We will explain more of this indices function in class next. See notes in Class05_02_NumpyCont.py
idlabels = np.indices( (4,3) ) 
print("idlabels:", idlabels)

i,j = idlabels  # idlabels is a tuple of length 2. We'll call those i and j
nparray2b = 10*i+j+11
print("nparray2b:",nparray2b)

# 1.a) Is nparray2 and nparray2b the "same"? Use the logical "==" test and the "is" test. 
# Write your codes, 
# and describe what you find.

# 1.b) What kind of object is i, j, and idlabels? Their shapes? Data types? Strides?
# 
# write your codes here

# 
# 1.c) If you change the value of i[0,0] to, say 8, print out the values for i and idlabels, both 
# before and after the change.
# 
# write your codes here
# Describe what you find. Is that what you expect?
#
# Also try to change i[0] = 8. Print out the i and idlabels again.

# ######  Part 1d      Part 1d      Part 1d   ##########
# 
# 1.d) Let us focus on nparray2 now. (It has the same values as nparray2b.) 
# Make a shallow copy nparray2 as nparray2c
# now change nparray2c 1,1 position to 0. Check nparray2 and nparray2c again. 
# Print out the two arrays now. Is that what you expect?
# 
# Also use the "==" operator and "is" operator to test the 2 arrays. 
# write your codes here
#

# ######  Part 1e      Part 1e      Part 1e   ##########
# Let us try again this time using the intrinsic .copy() function of numpy array objects. 
nparray2 = np.array(list2) # reset the values. list2 was never changed.
nparray2c = nparray2.copy() 
# now change nparray2c 0,2 position value to -1. Check nparray2 and nparray2c again.
# Are they true copies?
# 
# write your codes here
# Again use the "==" operator and "is" operator to test the 2 arrays. 
#
# Since numpy can only have an array with all values of the same type, we usually 
# do not need to worry about deep levels copying.

# Then change all the "inside" ones to zeros. (Leave the first 
# and last rows untouched, for all other rows, the first and last 
# values untouched.) 
# This way, when the array is finalized and printe out, it looks like 
# a square boundary with ones, and all zeros inside.

#%%
flatlist = list(range(1,25))
print(flatlist) 

#%%
# 6.1) create a numpy array from flatlist, call it nparray1. What is the shape of nparray1?
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.2) reshape nparray1 into a 3x8 numpy array, call it nparray2
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.3) swap columns 0 and 2 of nparray2, and call it nparray3
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.4) swap rows 0 and 1 of nparray3, and call it nparray4
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.5) reshape nparray4 into a 2x3x4 numpy array, call it nparray3D
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.6) from nparray3D, create a numpy array with boolean values True/False, whether 
# the value is a multiple of three. Call this nparray5
# remember to print the result
# 
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.7) from nparray5 and nparray3D, filter out the elements that are divisible 
# by 3, and save it as nparray6a. What is the shape of nparray6a?
# remember to print the result
#
# write your codes here
#

#%%
# 6.8) Instead of getting a flat array structure, can you try to perform the filtering 
# in 6.7, but resulting in a numpy array the same shape as nparray3D? Say if a number 
# is divisible by 3, keep it. If not, replace by zero. Try.
# Save the result as nparray6b
# remember to print the result
# 
# write your codes here
