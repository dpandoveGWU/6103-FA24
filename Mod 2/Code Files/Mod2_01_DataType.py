# Hello to everyone.

# This can get you a [link](http://www.gwu.edu).

# You can find some cheatsheets to do other basic stuff like bold-face, italicize, tables, etc.

# # Four basic data type in Python (compared to Java/C++, python is very limited that way, for good and bad)
# BIFS - boolean, integer, float, string

abool = True    # boolean
aboolstr = "True"     # str
azero = 0    # int
aint = 35    # int
aintstr = "35"     # str
afloat = -2.8     # float
afloatstr = "-2.8"     # str
anumbzerostr = "0"     # str
aemptystr = ""     # str
aletter = 'a'     # str
astr = "three-five"     # str

# %%
# First, let us try a little interactive - allow user input to set a parameter
userin = input("What is your name?")
print(f'Hello {userin}\n')

# %%
userin = input("What is your favorite integer?")
print(f'Your fav: {userin}')
print(f'Your fav: doubled: {userin * 2}\n')

# %%
# TRY AGAIN
userin = int(input("What is your favorite integer?"))
print(f'Your fav: {userin}')
print(f'Your fav: doubled: {userin * 2}\n')

# OR 
# Look up the eval() function in python, see what it does. 
userin = eval(input("What is your favorite integer?"))
print(f'Your fav: {userin}')
print(f'Your fav: doubled: {userin * 2}\n')

# f string inside the print function 


#%%
# higher level data types (class)
# list / array
alist = [1,'person',1,'heart',10,'fingers']

# tuple # like list, but an immutable object (faster access and processing)
atuple = (1,'person',1,'heart',10,'fingers')

# set  # un-ordered, and distinct elements.  
aset = { 1,'person',1,'heart',10,'fingers' }

#%%
# Access elements in a list:
# Remember that python COUNTS starting FROM ZERO

# They are shallow copies



#%%
# HOW to make true copy or deep copy???
# For simple (not nested) list/tuple/dictiionary, we can use these:
# 
alist = [1,'person',1,'heart',10,'fingers'] # reset alist
# the three lines below work the same
clist = list(alist)
clist = alist[:]
clist = alist.copy()
# clist = alist # this line is different, shallow copy, only pointing to the same memory locations
# At this point, even though alist and clist have all the exact same elements, we find:
print("Both lists have same elements:")
print(f'alist = {alist}')
print(f'clist = {clist}')
print(f'??alist == clist?? : {alist == clist}') # element-wise check
print(f'??alist is clist?? : {alist is clist}') # memory address check
# 
print("Now change clist:")
clist[2]=2
clist[3] = 'hands'
print(f'alist = {alist}')
print(f'clist = {clist}')
print(f'??alist == clist?? : {alist == clist}') # element-wise check
print(f'??alist is clist?? : {alist is clist}') # memory address check

#%%
# Now try the other data types: set, dictionary, set of dictionaries, list of tuples, 
# etc etc
# These are shallow copies. They just copy the reference address, not the (primitive) values. 
# How do we make static clones that are no longer tied?
# Try google
# Does that work for deep level objects like list of dictionaries?
#
print(alist) # check the values for alist
# reset adictionary3
adictionary3 = { "name": "Einstein", 2: "two", 3.14: 3.14159, True: 'loves', "last": alist }
# len(adictionary3)
acopy1 = adictionary3
acopy2 = adictionary3.copy()

import copy
acopy3 = copy.copy(adictionary3)

acopy1[2] = 'duo'

print(adictionary3)
print("acopy1", acopy1)
print("acopy2",acopy2)
print("acopy3",acopy3)

 
#%%
# Let us get some help from the package "copy"
#
# reset alist
alist = [1, 'person', 1, 'heart', 10, 'fingers']
# reset adictionary3
adictionary3 = { "name": "Einstein", 2: "two", 3.14: 3.14159, True: 'loves', "last": alist }

# len(adictionary3)
acopy1 = adictionary3
acopy2 = adictionary3.copy()

acopy3 = copy.copy(adictionary3)
acopy4 = copy.deepcopy(adictionary3)

print(adictionary3)
print("acopy1",acopy1)
print("acopy2",acopy2)
print("acopy3",acopy3)
print("acopy4",acopy4)


# %%[markdown]
# The copy.deepcopy() method works! It works recursively on lists/dictionary, etc, such as JSON objects. 
# Needless to say, use it only if it is needed, as it costs performance-wise. It also might not work if 
# the object type is other more complicated objects.
