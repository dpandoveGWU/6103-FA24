# Question 1: Create a Markdown cell with the followings:
# Two paragraphs about yourself. In one of the paragraphs, give a hyperlink of a website 
# that you want us to see. Can be about yourself, or something you like.


#%%
# Question 2: Create
# a list of all the class titles that you are planning to take in the data science program. 
# Have at least 6 classes, even if you are not a DS major
# Then print out the last entry in your list.


#%%
# Question 3: After you completed question 2, you feel Intro to data mining is too stupid, so you are going 
# to replace it with Intro to Coal mining. Do that in python here.


#%%
# Question 4: Before you go see your acadmic advisor, you are 
# asked to create a python dictionary of the classes you plan to take, 
# with the course number as key. Please do that. Don't forget that your advisor 
# probably doesn't like coal. And that coal mining class doesn't even have a 
# course number.

#%%
# Question 5: print out and show your advisor how many 
# classes (print out the number, not the list/dictionary) you plan 
# to take.

# Question 6: Using loops 
# Goal: print out the list of days (31) in Jan 2022 like this
# Sat - 2022/1/1
# Sun - 2022/1/2
# Mon - 2022/1/3
# Tue - 2022/1/4
# Wed - 2022/1/5
# Thu - 2022/1/6
# Fri - 2022/1/7
# Sat - 2022/1/8
# Sun - 2022/1/9
# Mon - 2022/1/10
# Tue - 2022/1/11
# Wed - 2022/1/12
# Thu - 2022/1/13
# ...
# You might find something like this useful, especially if you use the remainder property x%7
dayofweektuple = ('Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat') # day-of-week-tuple
