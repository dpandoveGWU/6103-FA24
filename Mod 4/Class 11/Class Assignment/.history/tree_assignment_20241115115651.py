#Import OJ data set which is part of the ISLP  package. 

#(a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations.  
# (b) Fit a tree to the training data, with Purchase as the response  and the other variables as predictors. What is the training error  rate?  
# (c) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results. How many  terminal nodes does the tree have?  
# (d) Use the export_tree() function to produce a text summary of  the ftted tree. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and interpret the  information displayed.  
# (e) Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion  matrix comparing the test labels to the predicted test labels.  What is the test error rate?
